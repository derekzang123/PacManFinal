# PacManFinal

For my final project, I am going to implement Pac-Man in Processing. The rules are simple enough: using the arrow keys, the player guides Pac-Man up, down, left, and right through a maze with dots for him to eat. The goal of the game is to clear the maze, but the player must also watch out for the ghosts which will chase after and try to capture him. Aside from recreating the iconic arcade game, I wanted to focus on understanding and ultimately adding my own twist on the different movement patterns of the ghosts: “chase” (actively follow Pac-Man through the maze), “scatter” (momentarily return to their respective home corners), and “frightened” (aimlessly wander the maze while Pac-Man is experiencing the effects of the energizer pellets).
